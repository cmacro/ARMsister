The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103ZE'
microcontroller using ST 'STM3210E-EVAL' Evaluation Board, compliant
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
   - button and joystick status
 - AD conversion is done in DMA mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2
   - USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F103 Trace:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                      (shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output)
